# 📚 Mini Book-store Management

A full-stack **book store management application** built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Nest.js). This project simulates a real-world e-commerce platform with essential features such as book browsing, shopping cart, user authentication, order placement, and an admin dashboard.

> 🛠️ **Frontend was fully built during hands-on practice in an online course.** Backend logic is adapted from an open-source learning project on YouTube.

## 🔒 Security

- Access/refresh token system with Axios interceptors
- Token expiration and auto re-login logic
- Route guards for protected pages

## 🧪 Key Learnings

This project helped reinforce the following:

- Building full-stack applications with MERN
- UI state management with Redux Toolkit
- Secure JWT-based auth handling
- Working with dynamic routes in Next.js
- Integration with third-party libraries: Antd, Chart.js, XLSX

---

## 📌 Notes

- Backend + MongoDB deployed on **Render**
- Frontend will be deployed using **Vercel**
- MongoDB Atlas used for production-ready database
  ⚠️ _Some parts of the UI are not fully responsive yet:_
  - _Homepage (customer view): partially responsive, needs refinement on tablet/mobile_
  - _Admin Dashboard: not responsive yet, planned for future updates_

---

## 🎯 Future Improvements

- Integrate payment gateways (Zalopay, Momo)
- Make the UI fully responsive (Homepage & Admin Dashboard)
- Migrate Customer UI from React-Bootstrap to Ant Design
- Improve responsive design using **Tailwind CSS**
